# Phaser 3 TS Project Template

This is a template for projects written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), built with [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) and using the game development framework [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/).

# Usage

Initialize the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Launch the development server:
 
```
npm start
```

# Adapt

* Update the project information in the `package.json` file.
* Set the title in the `index.html` file.
* Implement the code in the `src` folder and mix it the assets.

# IDE

Recommended editor: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

# A note on the coding style

I use an adaption of the [TypeScript Coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines), because I prefer them for reasons based on a quater of a century of coding experience on my back. Feel free to edit the `settings.json` file and the `.editorconfig`, but it won't get any better ;)
