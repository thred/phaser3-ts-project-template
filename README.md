# Phaser 3 TS Project Template

This is a template for projects written in [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), built with [Webpack 4](https://webpack.js.org/) and using the game development framework [Phaser 3](http://phaser.io/).

# Usage

Initialize the dependencies:

```
npm install
```

Launch the development server:
 
```
npm start
```

# Adapt

* Update the project information in the `package.json` file.
* Set the title in the `index.html` file.
* Implement the code in the `src` folder and mix it the assets.

# IDE

Recommended editor: 
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Recommended plugins: 
* [Beautify](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=HookyQR.beautify)
* [EditorConfig for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=EditorConfig.EditorConfig)
* [Sort Typescript Imports](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=miclo.sort-typescript-imports)
* [TSLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=eg2.tslint)

# A note on the coding style

I use an adaption of the [TypeScript Coding guidelines](https://github.com/Microsoft/TypeScript/wiki/Coding-guidelines), because I prefer them for reasons based on a lot of professional coding experience in large teams. Feel free to edit the `settings.json` file and the `.editorconfig`, but it will hardly get any better ;)
